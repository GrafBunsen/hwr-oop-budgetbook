## Abstract

With this expense tracker you keep track of your income and expenses. You can categorize your financial matters, export them to Excel and much more. With double-entry bookkeeping, you'll always be on the right side and quickly notice inconsistencies. The development of this project had a lot to do with data input and output, writing the tests was the most difficult part. Also, understanding the concept of double-entry accounting took the most brain power, among other things. Have fun using it!
